# Convolution_Neural_Network_Project
This is a project based off of ECE 449 material. In that class we built a Convolution Neural Network, and trained out CNN with the industry standard MNIST dataset. That project was built with C/C++ &amp; Python, but in this iteration; JAVA is the language we used. No Neural Network libraries were used, every layer was built out from scratch.
